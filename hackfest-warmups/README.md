# Hackfest Warmups

This repo contains warmup exercises for an e-Research Hackfest. You can customise the exercises with what you want to cover.

Each component of the platform has its own directory, with a README.md file describing each warmup exercise.

## Notes on Exercises  

  1. The exercise should be generic - no specific use case should be used.
  1. The exercise should start from scratch - assume no prior knowledge, or make that knowledge explicit for your hackfest.
  1. The exercises should make clear where the service endpoints are for the hackfest.
